Myself Abhishek Tyagi.I conducted an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a hotel booking dataset, employing various techniques to uncover valuable insights that can significantly enhance business strategies. The aim was to understand booking patterns, revenue trends, and customer behaviors to assist hotel management in making informed decisions.

The first major observation was the temporal analysis of booking traffic. Most bookings occurred in 2016, with a noticeable absence of booking traffic for the complete years in 2015 and 2017. Despite this, an intriguing finding emerged - the revenue for hotels reached its peak in 2017. This discrepancy suggests a potential focus area for business development, perhaps by exploring marketing strategies or understanding factors that led to increased revenue despite lower booking activity.

The analysis delved deeper into revenue sources, revealing that the highest daily earnings were derived from Transient customers. This indicates the significance of this customer segment in contributing to the hotel's daily income. Additionally, the analysis highlighted that the maximum revenue was generated from contract-type customers. This insight can guide the hotel management in devising targeted marketing strategies to attract and retain contract customers, potentially increasing overall revenue.

A critical challenge identified through the EDA was the need to address the high booking cancellation ratio. By understanding the factors contributing to booking cancellations, the hotels can implement measures to mitigate cancellations and improve overall reservation stability. This could include offering incentives for non-refundable bookings or implementing more flexible cancellation policies.

Furthermore, a noteworthy observation was made regarding the comparison between resort and city hotels. The data suggested that resort hotels tend to be more affordable than city hotels, providing a competitive advantage in attracting cost-conscious customers. This insight opens avenues for marketing campaigns emphasizing affordability, potentially increasing bookings for resort properties.

In conclusion, the EDA on the hotel booking dataset offered valuable insights for strategic decision-making. The temporal analysis, revenue source identification, and observations regarding booking cancellations and hotel types provide a comprehensive understanding of the business landscape. Moving forward, the hotel management can leverage these insights to refine marketing strategies, enhance customer experiences, and optimize revenue generation. The exploration undertaken in this analysis is a foundation for data-driven decision-making, positioning the hotel business for continued success and growth.
